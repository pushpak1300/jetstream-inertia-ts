## Introduction

This package is a fork of Laravel Jetstream that adds TypeScript support for the Inertia stack. Laravel Jetstream is a beautifully designed application scaffolding for Laravel. Jetstream provides the perfect starting point for your next Laravel application and includes login, registration, email verification, two-factor authentication, session management, API support via [Laravel Sanctum](https://github.com/laravel/sanctum), and optional team management.

Jetstream is designed using [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) and offers your choice of [Livewire](https://jetstream.laravel.com/stacks/livewire.html) or [Inertia](https://jetstream.laravel.com/stacks/inertia.html) scaffolding. This fork specifically enhances the Inertia stack with TypeScript support.

## TypeScript Support for Inertia

This fork adds full TypeScript support for the Inertia version of Laravel Jetstream. It provides type definitions and ensures that all Inertia components and related files are written in TypeScript, offering improved developer experience and type safety.

## Sync with Laravel Jetstream

This fork is maintained to stay in sync with the official Laravel Jetstream repository. We regularly update our codebase to incorporate the latest changes and improvements from the main Jetstream project, ensuring that you always have access to the most up-to-date features and bug fixes, along with our added TypeScript support for Inertia.
